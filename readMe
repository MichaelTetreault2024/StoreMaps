How to run:

Must download app.exe, Courier_New.ttf
Must also download all 6 of the files of type .dll

You can download these by clicking on the file and in the top right there is a download button

Check that the dll's downloaded properly because sometimes they can download but be unverified so you have to verify them.
I did this by clicking the download button in chrome and then the side arrow on each of the dll's and clicked "Download unverified file"

Then add all of these files to one folder and double click app.exe
Windows might give warning and if so just click More Info and then run anyway

How to use:
Click in the two white empty boxes and then type to input desired item.  Once both items are entered and you must press enter it will show a path if there is one.
If there is no path displayed then either one or both items dont exist or no possible paths.

Extra Details:
This is just to show a vague idea and not a full app.
